# CourseProject
CS 410 Group Project- Bias Detectives

At this point in the project, we have divided our work into three different technical approaches to determine which is the most accurate for our use case

Rules_Model
SVM_Model
RNN_Model

# Instruction for Testing SVM: 

$make install – installing all necessary packages in local dir 

$make data – build corpus 

$make train – train model 

$make test – test result
